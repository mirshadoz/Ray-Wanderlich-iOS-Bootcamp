My explanation about my choice between struct and class for my BullsEye app:
I chose a Class for my BullsEye model.
Main reason behind choosing Class, is that I feel more comfortable and appropriate using class 
for my entire Model part of the MVC.
Also, I have used a Struct for my Slider in the Model part. Because as I understand and feel, Structs are more appropriate for
partial elements such creating and initiating a slider to be used in any other class of the model.
